Movie Recommendation System - Collaborative Filtering

Goal: Build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their ratings and preferences.

Description: This project will implement a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. We'll use a dataset of user ratings for movies and apply a collaborative filtering algorithm to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users. Weâ€™ll use the Surprise library for implementing collaborative filtering techniques like SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and KNN-based filtering.

Steps:

Install Dependencies:

Install necessary libraries like pandas, surprise, and matplotlib.

Load and Preprocess Data:

Download the MovieLens dataset (e.g., ml-latest-small).

Load the movie and ratings data into Pandas DataFrames.

Clean and merge the datasets.

Create a User-Item Matrix:

Use the ratings data to create a matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and values represent ratings.

Collaborative Filtering using Surprise:

Use the Surprise library to build collaborative filtering models (SVD or KNN).

Split the dataset into training and test sets.

Evaluate the model using RMSE and MAE.

Generate Recommendations:

Predict ratings for movies that a user hasn't rated yet.

Recommend the top N movies with the highest predicted ratings.

Improve the Model:

Experiment with hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

Explore hybrid models or advanced algorithms for better results.

Deliverables:

A recommendation system that suggests movies to users.

Evaluation metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

Visualizations of top recommended movies for a user.

Replit Setup Instructions:

Create a new Python Replit project.

Install necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-surprise matplotlib
Load the MovieLens dataset (movies.csv and ratings.csv files).

Implement the collaborative filtering algorithm using the steps above.

Test the recommendation system for different users.
